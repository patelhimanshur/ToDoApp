# ToDoApp
This project aims to develop a TO-DO Web Application. The application allows the users to manage their To-Dos using a simple yet intuitive user interface. The web application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). It allows users to add, update, mark as complete, and delete tasks from their to-do list. The backend handles data storage and operations through MongoDB, while the front-end provides an interactive user interface using React.
